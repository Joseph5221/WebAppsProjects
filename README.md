Criteria
 - [ ] Data Model (6)
	- [ ] The final project includes at least two models/collections (6; three points for each entity)
	- [ ] See the Todo Project description for an idea of what this looks like
 - [ ] Backend (20)
	- [ ] GET (both / and /:thingId), POST, PUT, and DELETE routes are provided for each of the two entities (20; two points per route)
	- [ ] Remember that for a REST API, the GET route is for all entities and also for a specific entity (fetched by ID)
 - [ ] Frontend (26)
	- [ ] At least four frontend routes to create, read, update, and delete the entities created in the data model (16)
	- [ ] Four points per route to take into account data fetching, state management, and interactivity in form submission, etc
	- [ ] Some CSS styling; at least ten styles (10)
	- [ ] Using a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind is substitutable for the ten style requirement. This also should help speed up the process of styling the project.
 - [ ] Grading (6)
	- [ ] Zip up your code (2)
	- [ ] Include a README with notes on how to run the project if any special steps were taken (2)
	- [ ] Include a text file rating the effort each team member put into the project
